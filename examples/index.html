        <p>While few people outside of Seattle would&#8217;ve cared about a movie like <i>Hype! </i>had it not been for the very same media attention the film rails against, Pray steadfastly focuses his attention on the dimmer lights in the city&#8217;s musical galaxy&#8212;bands like Mono Men, Seaweed, Zipgun, Love Battery, Hovercraft, and Gas Huffer&#8212;instead of its big stars. The point of Pray&#8217;s film seems pretty obvious: The popularity of grunge didn&#8217;t put Seattle music on the map; it <i>ruined </i>Seattle music, because the emphasis suddenly shifted from having fun and creating idiosyncratic records to scoring contracts and making loads of money. <i>Hype! </i>spends a lot of time exploring how the media reduced Seattle to a set of simpleminded stereotypes&#8212;lumberjack clothes! dumb-guy guitar riffage!&#8212;that didn&#8217;t do justice to the city&#8217;s spirit of adventurous, non-trendy individuality.&#160;</p>

        </ol>

        <p>Unlike other &#8220;it&#8221; cities in rock history like Liverpool and San Francisco, Seattle never really had a honeymoon period in the spotlight. As <i>Hype! </i>shows, Seattle scenesters weren&#8217;t exactly inviting outsiders to come to their land of omnipresent rain and widespread heroin addiction with some flowers in their hair. Grunge seemed to arrive concurrently with grunge&#8217;s backlash; even stranger, the bands that stood to benefit the most from being associated with grunge were the ones fueling the backlash. Unlike punk and metal bands, which have typically been proud to declare themselves as such, grunge bands wore their tag with disdain.&#160;</p>

        <p>None of the Seattle musicians interviewed in <i>Hype! </i>come across as outwardly bitter, but there is an overall sense of resentment about grunge that sometimes seems justified (a lot of the mainstream media coverage of Seattle was stupid and reductive), but sometimes not, though that comes across in ways that Pray probably didn&#8217;t intend. While <i>Hype! </i>is an entertaining movie, it&#8217;s hardly revelatory; the bands you&#8217;ve never heard of don&#8217;t exactly seem unfairly ignored. They sound &#8220;local&#8221; in a bad way, with lots of scrappy punk-rock energy trying in vain to compensate for shouty, so-so singers and leaden songwriting. <i>Hype! </i>subtly suggests that the right bands were handed tickets to international fame and fortune.&#160;</p>

        <p>Among Pray&#8217;s most eloquent interview subjects was an Evanston, Illinois native who had only lived in Seattle for a few years, having moved up north in 1990 after working as a musician and a part-time night attendant at a gas station in San Diego for six years. But Eddie Vedder&#8217;s limited history in Seattle didn&#8217;t make him sound any less regretful about his band Pearl Jam reaping the rewards of rock stardom that so many of the city&#8217;s musicians missed out on. &#8220;They made a big mistake,&#8221; Vedder says ruefully at the movie&#8217;s 43-minute mark. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t go further and find more of the bands that were already here, and had been here even before many of the bands that exploded were. That&#8217;s what makes me feel guilty about the success of our band, because it should&#8217;ve been spread out to a number of bands.&#8221;</p>

        <p>When it came to rock stardom, Eddie Vedder was a socialist. But like so many celebrities before and after him, he blamed the media for his problem&#8212;which, presumably, was Pearl Jam selling more records than Gas Huffer&#8212;when he really should have blamed himself. Pearl Jam broke bigger than anybody else in Seattle because the band&#8217;s 1991 debut, <i>Ten, </i>satisfied a social need: It was spectacularly good at making alienated teenagers (i.e. <i>all </i>teenagers) feel less alone whenever they felt misunderstood by the rest of the world (i.e. every waking hour of the day).&#160;</p>

        <p>Bursting with intensely personal songs that sound universal by virtue of their oversized, near-operatic emotionalism, <i>Ten </i>was neither subtle nor particularly cool, which helped it communicate better and more profoundly with more people than any other rock record of its time. Along with <a target="_blank" href="/artists/metallica,22853/">Metallica</a>&#8217;s Black Album and <a target="_blank" href="/artists/radiohead,4291/">Radiohead</a>&#8217;s <i>OK Computer</i>, Pearl Jam&#8217;s <i>Ten </i>is easily one of the most influential mainstream rock records of the last 20 years. The power of <i>Ten </i>was so great that it eventually stood apart from Pearl Jam; as Vedder and his increasingly marginalized supporting cast distanced themselves from the record&#8217;s gauche chest-thumping by churning out progressively restrained, more &#8220;mature,&#8221; and less expressive music, <i>Ten </i>was dusted off by other bands and recycled again and again. Today, Pearl Jam is a popular touring band and intermittently successful on the charts; <i>Ten</i>, meanwhile, is still all over modern-rock radio, though only a handful of the songs are actually by Pearl Jam.&#160; &#160;</p>
