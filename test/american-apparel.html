    <p>It&rsquo;s hard not to be moved by the print ad&rsquo;s haunting images of
    desperation and sadness. Who were these emaciated young people with their gaunt flesh
    squeezed into gold lam&eacute; leggings, their dead eyes pleading for mercy and
    compassion? Why did a major chain choose advertising redolent of child pornography
    from the '70s? <b>Were these <i>runaways all right?</i> Had Charney forced them into lives</b> of
    prostitution, drug dealing, and pornography? Should I purchase American Apparel
    clothing, or report its owners and advertisers to the proper authorities?</p>

    <p>So when I saw a flier for an open casting call for American Apparel models
    yesterday on the way home, I seized upon an opportunity to learn firsthand about
    these sordid, hopeless creatures. My plan was simple: I would ingratiate myself into
    the American Apparel universe; learn where these poor, malnourished, and, it should
    be noted, very sexy children were being held against their will; and free them
    myself. I would become a one-man Underground Railroad, only for the underage and
    tragically hot.</p>

    <p>Actually, my thinking was actually a lot closer to &ldquo;Why the hell not?&rdquo;
    That is the governing principle behind many of my professional decisions. Wanna do a
    poorly rated, mildly disreputable basic-cable movie-review show in Canada with Erik
    Estrada and Jimmie Walker? Why the hell not? Wanna talk to Pauly Shore? Why the hell
    not? Want to audition to be the world&rsquo;s unlikeliest American Apparel model? Why
    the hell not?</p>

    <p>At the risk of engendering shock-induced monocle-shattering throughout our great
    land, I am not the world&rsquo;s most fashionable gentleman. My sartorial choices are
    usually ruled by apathy, but today I was unusually poorly dressed. To throw my
    competitors off their game and encourage a false sense of confidence, I decided to
    make myself look as disheveled as possible with an oversized <i>Eat Pray Love</i>
    promotional T-shirt<i>,</i> cargo shorts with three or four holes in random places,
    scuffed-up tennis shoes, and a thrift-store belt. Scruffy salt-and-pepper
    facial hair finished off a look that said &ldquo;homeless but hopeful,&rdquo; and
    also &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please spare a dollar or two?&rdquo; The only way I could
    have looked more out of place standing in line alongside the beautiful people would
    have been if I&rsquo;d shown up with my face painted like Violent J of <a target=
    "_blank" href="/artists/insane-clown-posse,35695/">Insane Clown Posse</a>.</p>

    <p>We would-be Tyson Beckfords and Cindy Crawfords were ordered to add our John
    Hancocks to a sign-in sheet, then asked to stand in line and wait patiently while
    three or four preppy-looking model scouts sat us down for 30-second conversations,
    then took our photographs, then forgot about us forever unless we were unusually
    beautiful or nailed the &ldquo;a lunatic has imprisoned me in his basement for the
    last four months. Please send help&rdquo; look.</p>

    <p>The aspiring human mannequins already looked like American Apparel models. The
    women were what one of my college friends called &ldquo;giraffes&rdquo;&mdash;tall,
    elegant women with endless legs and shiny, radiant hair who looked like they were
    headed to a shindig at Studio 54. Otherwise, androgyny ruled the day, as beautiful,
    muscular black men with delicate female features and anorexic emo boys with
    grad-school glasses huddled alongside wispy waifs in the Twiggy mold.</p>

    <p>I awkwardly struck up a conversation with the people ahead of me, a
    continental-looking giraffe in her third year at University of Illinois at Chicago
    and an ebullient blonde girl I will call Martha, who clutched her
    &ldquo;book&rdquo;&mdash;her portfolio of modeling pictures emblazoned with the logo
    of the modeling agency that used to represent her&mdash;like a security
    blanket.</p>

    <p>Giddy with the hubris of youth, this woman-child Martha announced &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t follow trends, I set them.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d been modeling for four
    years and boasted an intriguing combination of precocious world-weariness (this was
    far from her first time at the rodeo) and irrepressible youth.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So, are you able to make a living from modeling, or is this something you
    do on the side?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m not able to make a living at this.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your main gig, then?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a high-school student in Arlington Park. I start my senior
    year on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Her mother had been unemployed for the last two years, and she&rsquo;d turned to
    modeling both because it was clearly something she was naturally suited for, and to
    help pay the rent.</p>

    <p>She said the kids at school all wore the clothes of American Apparel, American
    Eagle, and many other chains with the word &ldquo;American&rdquo; in their name, but
    that her friends called her &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; because they thought she dressed
    European and shopped at Forever 21.</p>

    <p>If she were a rich woman, she announced sadly, she would buy so much fucking stuff
    from American Apparel.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But I thought they were cheap,&rdquo;I said
    obliviously.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; she shot back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have $40 to spend on
    a T-shirt.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She then rifled through her portfolio. It was remarkable how different she looked
    in each photo. Her fresh-faced, well-scrubbed look of pure Americana was eminently
    mutable. It was as if her face and body were unformed and unfinished and could only
    be completed by a stylist and photographer fitting her into their predetermined
    vision. She could be whoever they wanted her to be.</p>

    <p>Depending on the angle and the light, Martha could be a wild-eyed nymph or a
    continental urbanite or the girl next door. She noted sadly that Abercrombie
    &amp;amp; Fitch wanted to buy one of her photographs, but she didn&rsquo;t have the
    rights to the photos they wanted to buy; those were held, I suppose, by the
    photographers who took them or the modeling agency or the clients that bought
    them.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Shit, man. I could have been an Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch model,&rdquo;
    she muttered.</p>

    <p>I tried to console her. &ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of campaigns with them.
    They&rsquo;re not so great.&rdquo; But she did not pick up on my sarcasm.</p>

    <p>I told Martha I was a writer and planned to be upfront with the modeling scouts if
    they asked me why I was there. She didn&rsquo;t seem overly hopeful.
    &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how I see it going down: I think you&rsquo;re going to tell them
    you&rsquo;re a writer and then they&rsquo;ll tell you to leave.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I didn&rsquo;t have to wait long to find out. Martha swanned her way through a
    microscopic interview with the scouts, then smiled big for a pair of
    photographs.</p>

    <p>Then it was my turn. Hunchbacked, bald, gap-toothed, unshaven 34-year-old me. An
    elegant-looking young woman who could have stepped out of a Nagel painting introduced
    herself, shook my hand, and to her credit, refrained from laughing in my face or
    jabbing her partner and stage-whispering, &ldquo;Get a load of this
    freak.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There were no two ways about it: I was either a writer researching a piece or a
    lunatic, though there&rsquo;s an awful lot of overlap between the two.</p>

    <p>I sat down next to the woman and a gentleman who looked like a preppier Spike
    Jonze and was asked words I never imagined I would hear: &ldquo;Why do you want to be
    an American Apparel model?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s honest, and then there&rsquo;s too honest. The too-honest answer
    would have been &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to be an American Apparel model. I
    just find American Apparel&rsquo;s advertising morbidly fascinating, and I wanted to
    experience the weirdness of an open call for American Apparel models
    firsthand.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Instead, I answered, &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by
    American Apparel&rsquo;s advertising, and they&rsquo;re so weirdly iconic, and I
    worked nearby, so I figured I&rsquo;d stop by and see what it was all
    about.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The gentleman strained mightily to force a smile and nervously asked, &ldquo;Do
    you have any questions for us?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yes! Now was my chance to uncover the location of the underage models being kept
    in cages and forced to be sexy 20 to 23 hours a day! I was in a position to demand
    answers! I was going to take this whole house of cards down with me and expose the
    shocking, scintillating, titillating truth.</p>

    <p>But &ldquo;Uh, no, I guess not&rdquo; was all that came stumbling out of my
    mouth.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is it all right if we take two pictures?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course.&rdquo; I then smiled my signature closed-mouth smile (no
    need to afflict the populace with traumatic images of my teeth) and was photographed
    for posterity in my <i>Eat Pray Love</i> promotional T-shirt and hole-ridden
    shorts.</p>

    <p>That, friends, marked the premature end of my modeling misadventures. Or did it?
    Don&rsquo;t be surprised if a balding, pasty, stoop-shouldered, graying middle-aged
    man in filthy clothes becomes the next face and body of American Apparel.
    &rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t follow trends, motherfucker. I <i>make</i> them, and
    pasty, bald, graying, and middle-aged is the new skinny, sexy, toned, and 18.</p>
